# SDR_AVE_new


V. 2.6 compilation  x86, NET 4.7.2


This plugin is compatible with the newest SDR# v.1.0.0.1910 and probably newer. This is compiled with NET 4.7.2. Most of the problems with new versions of the SDR# and this plugin are related to the NET version. If it doesn't work try to compile this plugin with newer NET like 4.8.

Important notes:
IFave should work under Win 11 without any problems.


1. Copy the plugin with all DLL files to the plugin directory. 
2. Copy the plugin file 'ft2.xnb' to the main SDR# directory.
3. Add the magic sentence to the Plugins.xml file.
4. Enjoy
